# ARM Assembly Code Execution from Scratch
This repository provides a minimal setup to run ARM assembly code from scratch, without relying on boilerplate code or an IDE. It demonstrates how to create and run a main application program using bare-metal programming techniques.

This project showcases how to:

- Set up a bare-metal ARM environment.
- Write and assemble ARM assembly code.
- Link and execute the code directly on hardware or in an emulator.
- Avoid boilerplate code and integrated development environments (IDEs).
